# QML- Maxcut_Using_QAOA
Combinatorial optimization using Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm(QAOA). 
The Maximum cut problem is known to be NP-hard, **QAOA** is a general technique that harnesses the power of quantum computing to find a solution(approximate) to the combinatorial optimization problem.
